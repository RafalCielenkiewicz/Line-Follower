# Line Following Robot

## Project Description

This project focuses on creating a robot that can navigate a designated path by following a line using sensors. Infrared sensors and an Arduino Uno microcontroller where used to process signals from these sensors.


## Key Features

*   **Line Following:** Utilizing IR sensors to detect and follow a line.
*   **Speed Control:** A closed-loop control system that adjusts motor speeds to keep the robot on the line.
*   **Battery Powered:** Powered by two lithium-ion batteries.
*   **Custom Chassis:** A 3D-printed chassis designed for optimal sensor placement and stability.

## Technologies

*   **Microcontroller:** Arduino Uno
*   **Sensors:** Infrared (IR) sensors
*   **Motors:** DC motors with L293D motor driver shields
*   **Batteries:** Samsung lithium-ion batteries
*   **Chassis:** 3D-printed


## Summary

The project was successful, and the robot can accurately navigate a designated path. This project demonstrated the importance of iterative approaches and problem-solving in engineering.
